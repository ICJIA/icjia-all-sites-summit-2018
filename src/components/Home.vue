              <p>Please join us for Data, Planning, and Impact: A Joint Adult Redeploy Illinois and Criminal Justice Coordinating
                Councils Summit, in Bloomington May 8-10, 2018.
              </p>
              <p>Hosted by the
                <a href="http://www.icjia.state.il.us/" class="heavy">Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority</a>,
                <a href="http://www.icjia.state.il.us/redeploy" class="heavy"></a>Adult Redeploy Illinois</a>,
                <a href="https://www.luc.edu/ccj/" class="heavy">Loyola Universityâ€™s Center for Criminal Justice Research, Policy, and Practice</a>, and the
                <a href="http://www.ilcoe.us/" class="heavy">Illinois Center of Excellence for Behavioral Health and Justice</a>, the Summit will bring together a broad
                range of stakeholders from counties and judicial circuits either operating or interested in developing CJCCs
                and ARI-funded local prison diversion programs. Serving as both the seventh annual ARI All-Sites Summit and
                the second convening of CJCCs from around the state, the event will provide rich opportunities for mutual
                learning and foster coordinated decision-making.</p>
              <p>All three days will provide information and training that benefit members of CJCCs and ARI teams; however,
                if you cannot attend all three days, please attend the days that are geared toward your program affiliation.
                Day 1 (Tuesday, May 8 in the afternoon) will focus on CJCC technical assistance, Day 2 (Wednesday, May 9
                all day) will be combined CJCC and ARI programming, and Day 3 (Thursday, May 10 in the morning) will focus
                on ARI technical assistance. There will be networking events on Tuesday and Wednesday evenings.

              </p>
              <p> Those expected to attend are a spectrum of ARI and CJCC site stakeholders including but not limited to judges,
                prosecutors, defense attorneys, treatment providers, probation staff and supervisors, law enforcement, program
                coordinators, researchers, program partners, and policymakers. Summit content is structured for relevancy
                to a broad group of stakeholders. In addition to current ARI program representation, planning grantees are
                also invited and have previously benefited from talking with current sites and accessing system-wide training.
                The Illinois Center of Excellence for Behavioral Health and Justice will provide CEUs for LPC, LCPC, LSW,
                LCSW, LMFT, Psychologists, IAODAPCA, and CLEs for attorneys. CEUs will be provided for all three days.</p>

                  <a href="http://www.icjia.state.il.us/redeploy" class="heavy primary">Adult Redeploy Illinois</a> is a state initiative providing funding and technical assistance to local jurisdictions
                  to support the diversion of non-violent offenders from prison to more effective and less expensive community-based
                  supervision and services.</p>
                <p>ARI sites use grant funds to design and implement local programs that address offenders' risks and needs
                  and leverage their assets (family support, employment) to improve public safety and offender outcomes.
                  ARI has grown from five initial pilot sites in early 2011, to the current 22 sites implementing 45 programs
                  covering 45 Illinois counties (as of March 2018).</p>

            <div class="mr-auto">
              <p>Criminal Justice Coordinating Councils (CJCCs) are partnerships of decision makers who have a stake in the
                effective administration of justice. Typically the partnerships are organized at the county level and include
                representatives from:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>The 3 branches of government (executive, judicial, and legislative)</li>
                <li>Multiple levels of government (city, county, and state agencies)</li>
                <li>Allied stakeholders from various other governmental entities, such as education or health and human services,
                  community based organizations, service providers, and citizens</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                CJCCs follow a structured, data-driven planning process to identify, analyze, solve, and manage justice system issues. This
                work leads to better understanding of crime and criminal justice problems, greater cooperation among agencies
                and units of local government, clearer objectives and priorities, more effective resource allocation, and
                better quality criminal justice programs and personnel. Taken together, these results can increase public
                confidence in and support for criminal justice processes, enhancing system performance and, ultimately, the
                integrity of the law.</p>
