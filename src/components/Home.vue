              <p>The seventh annual ARI All-Sites Summit will focus on understanding, communicating, and expanding our impact.
                This year, ARI is partnering with the Criminal Justice Coordinating Councils (CJCC) to bring an even richer
                Summit experience to our sites and stakeholders, including an extra half-day of optional programming hosted
                by the CJCCs. CJCCs are partnerships of local criminal justice stakeholders, service providers, and community
                partners, often organized on the county level, that engage in collaborative criminal justice planning. We
                expect that sharing space at the Summit will provide many opportunities for mutual learning.</p>
              <p>The Summit will include a day and a half of panels, breakout sessions, technical training, and networking.
                ARI sites are also invited and encouraged to attend the optional pre-summit workshops in conjunction with
                CJCCs from around the state, on the afternoon of May 8th. The CJCC-focused sessions will include presentations
                on how to develop and implement strategic plans, as well as highlight projects undertaken by current CJCC
                partners (In McLean, McHenry, Lake, Winnebago, and St. Clair Counties) to improve their local criminal justice
                systems.
              </p>
              <p> Those expected to attend are a spectrum of ARI and CJCC site stakeholders including but not limited to judges,
                prosecutors, defense attorneys, treatment providers, probation staff and supervisors, law enforcement, program
                coordinators, researchers, program partners, and policymakers. Summit content is structured for relevancy
                to a broad group of stakeholders. In addition to current ARI program representation, planning grantees are
                also invited and have previously benefited from talking with current sites and accessing system-wide training.
                The Illinois Center of Excellence for Behavioral Health and Justice will provide CEUs for LPC, LCPC, LSW,
                LCSW, LMFT, Psychologists, IAODAPCA, and CLEs for attorneys. CEUs will be provided for all three days.</p>

                  <a href="http://www.icjia.state.il.us/redeploy" class="heavy primary">Adult Redeploy Illinois</a> is a state initiative providing funding and technical assistance to local jurisdictions
                  to support the diversion of non-violent offenders from prison to more effective and less expensive community-based
                  supervision and services.</p>
                <p>ARI sites use grant funds to design and implement local programs that address offenders' risks and needs
                  and leverage their assets (family support, employment) to improve public safety and offender outcomes.
                  ARI has grown from five initial pilot sites in early 2011, to the current 22 sites implementing 45 programs
                  covering 45 Illinois counties (as of March 2018).</p>

            <div class="mr-auto">
              <p>Criminal Justice Coordinating Councils (CJCCs) are partnerships of decision makers who have a stake in the
                effective administration of justice. Typically the partnerships are organized at the county level and include
                representatives from:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>The 3 branches of government (executive, judicial, and legislative);</li>
                <li>Multiple levels of government (city, county, and state agencies);</li>
                <li>and " Allied stakeholders from various other governmental entities, such as education or health and human
                  services, community based organizations, service providers, and citizens.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                CJCCs follow a structured, data-driven planning process to identify, analyze, solve, and manage justice system issues. This
                work leads to better understanding of crime and criminal justice problems, greater cooperation among agencies
                and units of local government, clearer objectives and priorities, more effective resource allocation, and
                better quality criminal justice programs and personnel. Taken together, these results can increase public
                confidence in and support for criminal justice processes, enhancing system performance and, ultimately, the
                integrity of the law.</p>
