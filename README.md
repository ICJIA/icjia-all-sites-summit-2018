# Adult Redeploy Illinois 2018 All Sites Summit

The seventh annual ARI All-Sites Summit will focus on understanding, communicating, and expanding our impact.
This year, ARI is partnering with the Criminal Justice Coordinating Councils (CJCC) to bring an even richer
Summit experience to our sites and stakeholders, including an extra half-day of optional programming hosted
by the CJCCs. CJCCs are partnerships of local criminal justice stakeholders, service providers, and community
partners, often organized on the county level, that engage in collaborative criminal justice planning. We
expect that sharing space at the Summit will provide many opportunities for mutual learning.
